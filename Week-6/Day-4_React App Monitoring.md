# Detailed Explanation of the React SRE Setup Script

This document explains the complete setup script for a React-based SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) application. The script automates the entire workflowâ€”from setting up dependencies to deploying the application in a Kubernetes environment with monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.

---

## 1. General Setup

### Directory Definitions
- **Project Directories:**  
  - `PROJECT_ROOT="$HOME/react-sre-project"`  
    The base directory for the entire project.
  - `REACT_APP_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/sre-react-app"`  
    Where the React application code is stored.
  - `K8S_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/kubernetes"`  
    Contains all Kubernetes configuration files.
  - `MONITORING_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/monitoring"`  
    Holds configuration for Prometheus and Grafana.
  - `SCRIPTS_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/scripts"`  
    Directory for automation scripts.
---

## 2. Initial Setup

### WSL Environment Check: `check_wsl()`
- **Purpose:**  
  Ensures that the script is being run within a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment.
- **Implementation:**  
  Greps the `/proc/version` file for the keyword "Microsoft". If not found, logs an error and exits.
---

## 3. Creating the React Application with SRE Instrumentation

### Creating the React App: `create_react_app()`
- **Purpose:**  
  Bootstraps a new React application.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Uses `npx create-react-app` to create a new React project.
  - Changes into the React application directory.
  - Installs additional dependencies needed for SRE instrumentation, including:
    - `axios` for making HTTP requests.
    - `react-router-dom` for routing.
    - `swr` for data fetching.
    - `@prometheus/client` (or similar) for metrics.
    - `react-error-boundary` for handling UI errors.
    - `@grafana/ui` for potential UI integrations.
    - `history` for navigation management.
  - Logs the successful creation of the React app.

### Adding SRE Instrumentation: `create_react_sre_files()`
- **Purpose:**  
  Adds custom components and services to the React app for monitoring and error handling.
- **Components and Services:**
  - **HealthCheck Component (`HealthCheck.jsx`):**
    - Periodically fetches the `/api/health` endpoint.
    - Displays backend health status, uptime, and dependency statuses.
  - **ErrorBoundary Component (`ErrorBoundary.jsx`):**
    - Catches JavaScript errors in child components.
    - Displays a fallback UI and logs errors via the SRE metrics system.
  - **Metrics Service (`metrics.js`):**
    - **Counter Class:**  
      - Maintains a counter value and sends increment events to the backend.
    - **Gauge Class:**  
      - Tracks a variable value (e.g., memory usage) and sends updates.
    - **Histogram Class:**  
      - Records observations (e.g., page load times) and sends data to the backend.
    - Sends data using `navigator.sendBeacon` to the `/api/metrics` endpoint.
  - **App Component (`App.js`):**
    - Sets up routing for the app (Home, Dashboard, Error Test).
    - Integrates the HealthCheck and ErrorBoundary components.
    - Uses the metrics service to track navigation events and trigger error reporting.

## 6. Kubernetes Configuration

### Base Kubernetes Files
- **Namespace (`namespace.yaml`):**  
  Defines a dedicated namespace `react-sre-app` for the application.
  
- **Deployment (`deployment.yaml`):**  
  - Specifies how the React application is deployed:
    - **Replicas:** Default set to 2.
    - **Container Image:** Uses the `react-sre-app:latest` image.
    - **Ports:** Exposes port 3000.
    - **Resource Limits:** Sets CPU and memory limits/requests.
    - **Probes:** Configures readiness and liveness probes using the `/health` endpoint.
    - **Prometheus Annotations:** Adds annotations (`prometheus.io/scrape`, etc.) for metric scraping.
  
- **Service (`service.yaml`):**  
  Exposes the deployment via a ClusterIP service on port 80.
  
- **Ingress (`ingress.yaml`):**  
  Configures external access using an Ingress resource with Nginx, rewriting paths appropriately.
  
- **Kustomization (`kustomization.yaml`):**  
  Lists all the above resources for deployment using Kustomize.

### Overlay Configurations
- **Dev Overlay (`overlays/dev`):**
  - **Replica Count Patch (`replica-count.yaml`):**  
    Reduces the replica count (e.g., to 1) for a development environment.
  - **Resource Limits Patch (`resource-limits.yaml`):**  
    Adjusts resource limits to lower values suitable for development.
  - **Kustomization File:**  
    Applies patches to the base configuration and adds a name prefix (e.g., `dev-`).

- **Prod Overlay (`overlays/prod`):**
  - **Replica Count Patch (`replica-count.yaml`):**  
    Increases the replica count (e.g., to 3) for production.
  - **Resource Limits Patch (`resource-limits.yaml`):**  
    Sets higher resource limits to handle production loads.
  - **Kustomization File:**  
    Applies these patches and adds a name prefix (e.g., `prod-`).

### Dockerfile and Nginx Configuration
- **Dockerfile for React App:**
  - **Build Stage:**  
    Uses a Node.js Alpine image to install dependencies and build the React app.
  - **Production Stage:**  
    Uses an Nginx Alpine image to serve the built application.
  - **Health Check and Metrics:**  
    Copies a custom `nginx.conf` and creates a health check endpoint at `/health` and a metrics endpoint at `/metrics` (which returns mock Prometheus metrics).

- **Nginx Configuration (`nginx.conf`):**
  - Configures Nginx to:
    - Serve static files for the React application.
    - Expose the `/health` endpoint returning a JSON status.
    - Expose the `/metrics` endpoint with sample Prometheus metrics.
    - Define error pages for HTTP 404 and 50x errors.

## 7. Monitoring Configuration

### Prometheus Configuration
- **Prometheus YAML (`prometheus.yaml`):**
  - **Global Settings:**  
    Sets scrape interval, evaluation interval, and scrape timeout.
  - **Alerting:**  
    Configures Alertmanager with static configurations.
  - **Scrape Configs:**  
    Defines jobs for scraping metrics from Prometheus itself and the React SRE app (using Kubernetes service discovery and relabeling rules).
  
- **Alert Rules (`alert-rules.yaml`):**
  - Specifies alerts for:
    - High error rate: Triggers if HTTP 5xx errors exceed 5% of total requests.
    - High response time: Alerts when the 95th percentile response time exceeds 1 second.
    - High memory usage: Alerts when memory usage exceeds 85% of the limit.

- **Kubernetes ConfigMap:**  
  Creates a ConfigMap (`prometheus-config`) that contains the Prometheus configuration and alert rules, which is mounted into the Prometheus pod.

### Grafana Configuration
- **Datasource Configuration (`datasource.yaml`):**  
  Configures Prometheus as the default data source in Grafana.
  
- **Dashboard Configuration (`react-sre-dashboard.json`):**  
  A prebuilt dashboard JSON file that defines various panels to visualize:
  - HTTP request rates.
  - Response times (using histogram quantiles).
  - Error rates, memory usage, CPU usage.
  - Pod availability.
  
- **Kubernetes Deployment for Grafana:**  
  Deploys Grafana in the `monitoring` namespace using a ConfigMap to provision datasources and dashboards. A Service is defined to expose Grafana on port 3000.
